# Celer Routes

## Description

Celer is a routing engine used for *The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild* speedruns, made by [Pistonight](https://github.com/iTNTPiston). This repository is acting as a collection for all of the ones that I wrote!

## Important

It is strongly recommended that you familiarize yourself with the current WR route of the category that you are aiming to run. The links to the WR videos will always be linked in the corresponding route document.
